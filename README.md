# Express Music

Deployed at http://express-music.herokuapp.com

## About The Site

This website is a practical implementation of my Node.js and Express.js learnings. The site features my favorite bands. Each of these bands were given a dedicated route. Data for the bands is being fetched from a data.json file.


## My learnings

**Consistent routing to modules**<br/>
**Making exact view behave differently depending of where it is inserted**<br/>
**Using middleware**<br/>
**Using client-side templating language - EJS**<br/>
**Building flexible views**<br/>
**Creating an API route**<br/>
**Organize Web app into MVC architecture**<br/>
