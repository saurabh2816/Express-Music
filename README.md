# Express Music

Deployed at http://express-music.herokuapp.com

## About The Site

This website is a practical implementation of my Node.js and Express.js learnings. The site features my favorite bands. Each of these bands were given a dedicated route. Data for the bands is being fetched from a data.json file.


## My learnings

**Consistent routing to modules **
**Making exact view behave differently depending of where it is inserted **
**Using middleware**
**Using client-side templating language - EJS**
**Building flexible views**
**Creating an API route**
**Organize Web app into MVC architecture**
